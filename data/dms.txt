nightcat_yeah: Boy oh boy where do I even begin. R16..
honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you
ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way
you drive into the paint and strike fear
into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth
touch around the rim, and that gorgeous
Quad Mag. I would do anything for you. I
wish it were possible to freeze time so I
would never have to watch you retire. 
You had a rough start as a starter weapon, but you never gave up hope. You are even an amazing weapon, you're a great gun, sometimes I even call you "God". I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day be Nerfed. I would sacrifice my own life It was the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you were criticized by the RE:Infected community, my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first round in Chaos Canyon, because deep down,my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced.
2022 was a hard year for us baby, but in
2024 you made history happen. You came
back from level 91and I couldn't believe it.
 I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my
glorious king exclaim these words,
"RE:INFECTED FOR YOU!" Not only
have you changed the game ofRE:Infected  forever, but you've eternally
changed my world. And now you're getting
older, but still the goat, my goat. I love
you pookie bear, my glorious king, R16.
