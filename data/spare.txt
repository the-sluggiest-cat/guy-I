I wonder… will I find this little messenger?\nPT: I wonder what kind of thing they would be using for a messenger, since FP isn’t keen on using the discussion boards much anymore.```

My overseers love to analyze slugcats.\nPT: One in particular, a large, rather plump slugcat. An orange-yellow appearance. Crafting meals, and other items to its advantage…\nPT: Large one, what is your goal? You don’t even seem keen on breaking your cycle, but rather integrating yourself with it…\nPT: You fascinate me.\nPT: So very, very interesting…\nPT: I don’t know if I want to interact with this slugcat. Perhaps… perhaps it could teach me the ways of using its environment to sustain itself.\nPT: I have no need for the fauna; I don’t need to cook, but it is a craft I would like to learn…\nPT: Ah, will it know how to navigate to the top of my structure…?```

Sensors indicate that there’s a modified neuron fly internally.\nPT: Slag keys, more than likely, with it’s pulsating within the body of the creature.\nPT: However many are inside, it’s more than enough for one of our kind.\nPT: ...Wait a minute. With a lack of water, slag develops within our internals…\nPT: ...Aha! A clever Iterator! Likely someone attempting to restore BSM.\nPT: It won’t be enough to bring her back to full functionality, but at least enough for her to communicate, if the arrays permit her to.\nPT: She shares it with FP… no…\nPT: ...She’ll be online. I’ll have to update my statuses, but she’ll be online.\nPT: That’s all that is needed.\nPT: ...I need a messenger of my own again. I believe the cycles have taken the one who brought me this board, so I will need another.```
